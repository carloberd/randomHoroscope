# Mixed Messages: Random Horoscope
## This is the first portfolio project of my Codeacademy course

**Scope of this project:**
- Making a program that visualize a new random message each time a user launch it
    This message could be a greeting, inspirational quote, astrology prediction, etc..
- These messages should be made up by at least three different pieces of data
    This means that all phrases must not be pre-packaged

**Languages and tools** 
- Javascript 
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub

**Type of messages**: *Random Horoscope*

This is a very simple project of mine, done to improve and use some new javascript skills 
and in the meantime learn to use Git and GitHub.

**How it works**
Acording to astrology, each zodiac sign belong to an element: 
- Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are **Fire**
- Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio are **Water**
- Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn are **Earth**
- Aquarius, Gemini and Libra are **Air**
If you look at the code, there are 24 trait in the array "elements", subdivided in groups of 6 that 
belongs to the elements written above. The program select a random trait based on your sign element.
